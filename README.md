# A Study of Association Between Dietary Iron Intake and Coronary Heart Disease
Using STATA, my team and I explored the association between dietary iron intake and coronary heart disease given a case control study from Athens, Greece (Jan 1990 to April 1991). Using log-odds models, we explored the data, compared various models, and selected the best model by performing the likelihood ratio test and the Pearson Chi-square goodness of fit test. Our analysis found that iron interacts with men and women differently. For women, increased iron intake showed increase odds of coronary heart disease. For men, the relationship between iron intake and coronary heart disease was nonlinear.
